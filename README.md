#  ConsenSys Academyâ€™s 2019 Developer Bootcamp Final Project 

What does your project do?

The goal is this project was to use the Zokrates framework and create a custom protocol based on zk-snarks to prize (non fungible ERC721) users completing a pre-defined tasks. This concept could be easily enhanced and be used in a certification flow process in industries like aeropspace, banking, online universities, engineering after completion of an exam. The value proposition of such solution/framework is inherent to the nature of the blockchain (public access and immutable) but also with the ZKP capabilities to subsitute a manual and tamperable process with a fully automated and secure process. 

As a demo, this project used a basic game (Mastermind) concept to be validating its solution with zk-snarks. The game UI interface was not implemented as it would not add much value. The current application focused on setting up all the different components from a blockchain protocol perspective but not the dynamic lifecycle of the game itself (propose the colors). The ideal state would be to have the zk-snark output of the program to return the Zokrates output to be used inside the smart contract, but this is not possible today. Only a true/false output is given.  

From an architecture setup, ideally we would like to have 3 main components:
   - trusted web3 layer allowing the user to create a proof to pass on the blockchain against a specific game (also need the real colors to be centralized to build the proof).
   - node.js simple interface to interface with a blockchain
   - smart contracts on the blockchain
   
Note: For simplicity, we decided to exclude the trusted setup allowing to create a proof. This choice was made to avoid deployment complexity created by the zk-snarks trusted setup constraints. The following chapters will go in detail in how to setup locally, but do not share the deployed version to facilitate the testing.
